# Error running Jest

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51127176/unexpected-token-import-error-while-running-jest-tests

## install
`npm install`
## run 
`npm run dev`
## recreate test error
`npm run test`

Note: this is a boiler plate to recreate the issue, the import statements for the vue awesome icons in the hello-world component are causing the error
